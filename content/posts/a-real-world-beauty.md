### Introduction

Welcome! 
Chances are that you stumbled over the term "functional programming" in the past but unfortunately never got the opportunity to engage in the topic during your studies or as part of your work.
I wrote this article to solidify my own perspective on the matter and to underline a couple of corresponding features I hope you are going to appreciate at least conceptually.

Where do we begin? 
Let us departure from shared ground. I'am going to present a fairly widespread definition of Object Oriented Programming(OOP) and point out a non exhaustive list of associated features in the aftermath.

>"Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept objects, which can contain data and code: data in the form of fields (often known as attributes or properties), and code in the form of procedures (often known as methods)."
